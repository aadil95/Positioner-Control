# Positioner-Control
The Problem statement image file contains the problem that will be solved in this project.
Summary: A positioner needs to be controlled between 2 positions. A control system also needs to be developed for the plant.

Solution.pdf describes the approach for this problem. Scilab code is also attached in order to create the dynamical simulation for the plant along with the controller.
